# Handoff Notes

## Session summary (2026-10-02)

Work done on `marc_repair.py` this session:

1. **MARC-8 multi-byte truncation now surfaces as a logged failure.**
   pymarc's `marc8_to_unicode()` doesn't raise for a truncated multi-byte
   (CJK/EACC) character -- it writes `"Multi-byte position X exceeds
   length of marc8 string Y"` straight to stderr and silently substitutes
   a blank space. `transcode_marc8_to_utf8` now captures stderr around
   that call and converts the warning into a proper `RuntimeError`,
   labeled with the tag/subfield and ~10 bytes of context around the
   truncation point. Flows through the existing `transcode_marc8_failed`
   category (already always fully logged via `--log`). See
   `_Marc8MultibyteTruncated` / `_MARC8_MULTIBYTE_TRUNCATED_RE`.

2. **Repaired output always gets a `.mrc` extension**, regardless of the
   input's own extension (`.marc`, `.dat`, `.txt`, or none). Fixed in
   `_default_output_path`, the split-mode bib/holdings repaired paths,
   and `--repair-holdings`'s default path. This matches what `--out`'s
   help text already promised but the code didn't deliver.

3. **Added `--sample-problems PATH` / `--sample-limit N`** (default limit
   25). Writes the raw, original bytes of up to N records that
   triggered at least one not-fixed finding (unfixable,
   `transcode_marc8_failed`, `suspect_marc8_escape`, etc.) to PATH as a
   small standalone `.mrc` file -- for handing a compact sample of a
   file's actual problems to someone (or something) else for analysis,
   without sending the whole file.
   - **Known limitation:** only wired into the default bib pipeline in
     `main()`, not `--repair-holdings` or `--split-bib-holdings` yet.
   - **Known limitation:** misses the rare case where a tag gets renamed
     (`pending_tag_fixes`, logged only after the whole loop ends) or a
     duplicate identifier is found (found only after a full pass) --
     both happen after the per-record sampling check runs.

All 326 tests passing (1 skipped) as of this session's last run.

## DONE: truncate duplicate-245 body in the log detail

Confirmed with an actual sample: the long string was never the section
header (those stay fixed, e.g. "=== FIXED/REQUIRES ATTENTION:
removed_non_repeatable_duplicate ==="); it was the removed field's own
content embedded in the per-record detail line by
`strip_duplicate_non_repeatable_fields` (`marc_repair.py:3337` after
this change, logged around `marc_repair.py:5875`) -- most visibly on
an exact-duplicate 245, where the full title (indicators + all
subfields) got echoed verbatim even though "exact duplicate" already
says all a reader needs to know.

Added `_DUPLICATE_FIELD_BODY_TRUNCATE_LEN = 25` and truncate the
field's rendered body (indicators+subfields, or control content) to
that length + "..." before building the detail string, for every tag
this check handles (001/005/008/245/etc.), not just 245 -- the same
long-body problem applies to any non-repeatable tag with free-text
content. Short bodies (e.g. an edition statement like "2nd ed.") are
left untouched.

New tests: `test_long_title_body_truncated_in_detail`,
`test_short_body_not_truncated` in `tests/test_marc_repair_bib.py`.

All 328 tests passing (1 skipped), flake8 clean.
